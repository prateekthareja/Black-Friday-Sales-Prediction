## Description:
A retail company wants to understand the customer purchase behavior (specifically, purchase amount) against various products of different categories. They have shared purchase summary of various customers for selected high volume products from last month. The data set contains customer demographics, product details and purchase amount from last month.
Now, they want to build a model to predict the purchase amount of customer against various products which will help them to create personalized offer for customers against different products.

I have built a model for the same problem, which predicts the purchase amount. XGBoost algorithm was used for this task.
